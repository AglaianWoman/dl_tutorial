# Tutorials for deep learning.

In this place I like to collect tutorials for deep learning. Currently I have done a tutorial for the great [lasagne](lasagne) framework, a tutorial on [TensorFlow](tensorflow) is in preparation.

The [lasagne](lasagne) tutorial was given at the [Zurich Machine Learning Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Zurich-Machine-Learning/events/221004771/?eventId=221004771) slide can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9154523/talks/ConvNets_ZH_ML.pptx.pdf)
