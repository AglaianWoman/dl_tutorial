### Some notebooks on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

* [simple_rnn_tf1.ipynb](simple_rnn_tf1.ipynb) A RNN for a simple process. Feedforward in numpy, training in TensorFlow using the RNN library (works with tf1.0 and python 3.4). 

* [simple_rnn.ipynb](simple_rnn.ipynb) A RNN for a simple process. In addition to the above notebook it also contains code for training it in TensorFlow from scratch (does not work with tf > 0.12)

* [Loading_Frozen_RNN_Model.ipynb](Loading_Frozen_RNN_Model.ipynb) A notebook, which samples a char-rnn from a frozen network. The network has been trained using the script [lstm_generator_didaktik.py](lstm_generator_didaktik.py)
